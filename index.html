            I like the Harry Potter Character because he is a very brave boy , when he was small he lost his parents. And because of his Bravery he is Famous.
            He got the admission into a magic boarding school 'Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry'. There he met three close friend 'Hormoine' 'Ronald'and 'Hagrid'. This a fictional character created by J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.
